##Project note
There isn't many things to note but I did use several external library for the whole project. Notably the charts. I use 
Apex chart as it's identical with the one shown in Figma. As for the table I find it hard to match exactly how it would 
look like in the Figma so I had to adjust as much as I could.

Another thing is probably the API, I had to manipulate the data returned from the API as it was not up to my design
I had to clean the JSON returned from the API so it can be easily read by the charts and table.
